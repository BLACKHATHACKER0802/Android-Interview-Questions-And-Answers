# Android Interview Questions And Answers

-   **What is an Application class?**<br/>
    A) An Application class is a base class in your Application starts before all other classes like Activities or services are called. You can maintain your application's global state here. While it is NOT mandatory that you need to extend Application class, you can do so by providing your own implementation by creating a subclass and specifying the fully-qualified name of this subclass as the "android:name" attribute in your AndroidManifest.xml's <application> tag.

-   **What is a Context? What are different types of Contexts?**<br/>
    A) As the name says, its the context of the current application or object. Context is like a handle to the environment your application is currently running in.
    We mainly use two types of context. Application context - whose scope is throughout the application and Activity Context - whose scope depends on the Activity Lifecycle.

-   **What is an Intent?**<br/>
    A) It is a kind of message or information that is passed to the components. It is used to launch an activity, display a web page, send SMS, send email, etc. There are two types of intents in android:
    a)Implicit Intent
    b)Explicit Intent

-   **What is Pending Intent?**<br/>
    A)A PendingIntent is a token that you give to a foreign application (e.g. NotificationManager, AlarmManager, Home Screen AppWidgetManager, or other 3rd party applications), which allows the foreign application to use your application's permissions to execute a predefined piece of code. It specifies a task that requires to be performed in future.

-    **When to use AsyncTask and when to use services?**<br/>
    A) Services are useful when you want to run code even when your application's Activity isn't open. AsyncTask is a helper class used to run some code in a separate thread and publish results in main thread. Usually AsyncTask is used for small operations and services are used for long running operations.


-   **What is a Looper?**<br/>
    A) A Looper is a class used to loop through the Message Queue attached to the Thread. By default, a thread halts when the execution completes. But, for Example, if we take Android's Main thread, it should not halt upon execution.
    Rather it should loop through the runnables(Messages) that its assigned in order to work properly. For more info, refer to this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34522758/3424919).

-   **What is a Handler?**<br/>
    A) A Handler allows you to send and process Message and Runnable objects associated with a thread's MessageQueue. Each Handler instance is associated with a single thread and that thread's message queue. When you create a new Handler, it is bound to the thread / message queue of the thread that is creating it -- from that point on, it will deliver messages and runnables to that message queue and execute them as they come out of the message queue.

-   **How to save password safely in Android?**<br/>

-   **String a = “abc”;  String b = new String(“abc”); Will a == b ??**<br/>
    A) It depends. Here with the first statement, i.e, String a = “abc”, JVM will search for a string with “abc” in String constant pool(SCP) and if its not there it will create a new Object.
    If we wrote second statement similarly, i.e., String b = “abc”, then b will point to same string from SCP.
    However, String b = new String(“abc”) always creates a new String object.

-  **What is Alarm Manager?**<br/>
    A) AlarmManager is a class which helps scheduling your Application code to run at some point of time or at particular time intervals in future. When an alarm goes off, the Intent that had been registered for it is broadcast by the system, automatically starting the target application if it is not already running. Registered alarms are retained while the device is asleep (and can optionally wake the device up if they go off during that time), but will be cleared if it is turned off and rebooted.

### RxJava Related Questions:

-   **What is single in RXJava2?**<br/>
    A) A single in RXJava2 is an Observable which emits only one item if completed or returns error.

-   **What is Completable in RXJava2?** <br/>
    A) A Completable in RXJava2 is an Observable which just completes the task and does not emit anything if completed. It returns an error if anything fails.
    It is similar to reactive concept of runnable.
